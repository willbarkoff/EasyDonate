As of right now, Donorfide doesn't actually collect any data. Hypothetically, once we hit beta, it will start collecting data, but right now, no data is collected.

Once we do start collecting data, this policy will be updated to reflect that.

The Donorfide development team disclaims all responsibility for data leaks or losses. It is your responsibility to update yourself on this policy, as you may not be notified of changes.
